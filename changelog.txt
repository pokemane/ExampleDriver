0.1.0 Alpha


Set up the example program to use the message library.  The key is the in-place element structures.
Set up to work by using a single "Execute.vi" method in the consumer loop.


Check out the comments.  I have basically explained the entire process in there.
Will be updating the changelog hereafter with anything that changes.
